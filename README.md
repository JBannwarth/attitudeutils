# Attitude Utilities

This Python package contains functions to describe attitude and convert between attitude representations.

The conventions used follow that in the following textbook:
H. Schaub, J. L. Junkins. Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems, AIAA Education Series, 2nd Edition, Reston, VA, 2009. [![DOI:10.2514/4.867231](http://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.2514/4.867231-B31B1B.svg)](https://doi.org/10.2514/4.867231).

This package was created as part of my study of spacecraft control. Consequently, my aim was to understand the equations first and foremost rather than creating a novel package.

For efficient Python algorithms to deal with quaternions, see [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/27896013.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/27896013) instead. For an exhaustive implementation of all the functions presented in Schaub and Junkins, see https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/suppl/10.2514/4.105210.
